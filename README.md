### Hi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Stefan, a front-end developer from Germany.

My focus is on HTML, CSS, Accessibility and Progressive Enhancement.  
When I use JavaScript, I like to limit myself to browser APIs whenever possible.

The web has come a long way. Features that used to require libraries or frameworks can now easily be implemented using vanilla JavaScript.

Such an approach keeps the codebase small, avoids bugs, and improves the performance.

I use the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) to build websites, because it provides better performance, higher security as well as easier and cheaper scaling.

Since 2004 I have been working in this business.

### My skills and experience include:

+ HTML and (S)CSS
+ Responsive Web Design
+ Accessibility and Progressive Enhancement
+ Vanilla JavaScript
+ Web Components, LitElement, and lit-html
+ Jest, Mocha, and Chai
+ Redux and Redux-Saga
+ Webpack, Git, and Continuous Integration
+ Docker
