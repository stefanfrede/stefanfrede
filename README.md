### Hi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Stefan, a front-end developer from Germany.

My focus is on HTML, CSS, Accessibility and Progressive Enhancement.  
When I use JavaScript, I like to limit myself to browser APIs whenever possible.

The web has come a long way. Features that used to require libraries or frameworks can now easily be implemented using vanilla JavaScript.

Such an approach keeps the codebase small, avoids bugs, and improves the performance.

Since 2004 I have been working in this business.

### My skills and experience include

+ HTML and (S)CSS
+ Responsive Web Design
+ Accessibility and Progressive Enhancement
+ Vanilla JavaScript
+ Web Components & Lit
+ Vue.js & Nuxt
+ Jest, Mocha, and Chai
+ Vite, Git, and Continuous Integration
+ Docker
