### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am Stefan, a front-end developer from Germany.

My focus is on HTML, CSS, accessibility, and progressive enhancement.

When I use JavaScript, I prefer to limit myself to browser APIs whenever possible.

The web has made significant progress. Features that previously required libraries or frameworks can now be easily implemented using vanilla JavaScript.

This approach has several benefits: it keeps the codebase small, avoids bugs, and improves performance.

I have been working in this business since 2004.

### My skills and experience include

+ HTML and CSS
+ Responsive Web Design
+ Accessibility and Progressive Enhancement
+ Vanilla JavaScript
+ Web Components & Lit
+ Vue.js and Nuxt
+ Docker and Git
